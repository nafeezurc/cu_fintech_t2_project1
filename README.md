# Project 1

## Risk analysis application that generates a portfolio based on a user's risk apetite

## TODO:

- Add Graphs from Notebook to justify the stock selection (MCStocks.ipynb file)
- Modify script to show multiple graphs at the same time (stocks.py)
- Present the results nicely (simulation summary table)
