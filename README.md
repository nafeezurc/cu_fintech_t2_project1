### PY invest

PY invest is a python application that gives a user a portfolio based upon their risk tolerance.
Out of 11 stock sectors and 2 different cryptos py invest will determine based off of the assets volatility and the users risk what to hold and how much to hold.

## Usage

An indivdual answers a series of 8 questions so that way we can determine their risk tolerance.
The portfolio that is generated will be different based upon our insight of their risk tolerance. 

## Output

The past performance of all the stocks, and if needed, cryptos in the given portfolio.
A Monte Carlo simulization of the predicted returns.
Data from that simulation.
